# Predicting_Weight_Lifting_Exercises
One thing that people regularly do is quantify _how much_ of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify _how well_ they do it. Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: one was the correct exercise while the other four classes correspond to common mistakes. In this project, I will use machine learning and data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This report will use the R programming language for all machine learning applications. More information on the dataset and experiment can be found [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har): see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset.
